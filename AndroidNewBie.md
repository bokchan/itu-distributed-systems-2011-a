Main source for info such as api, tutorial(s) etc.: http://developer.android.com

## Android installation ##

Prerequisite: Eclipse 3.6/3.7 with Java 1.6

Install Android SDK and Android Eclipse Plugin through Eclipse

Start to choose one or two api levels at least Android 2.1 / level-7 - its also recommended to install the examples/samples for that specific level.

With Android 2.1 / level-7 its easy to roll out the Andorid app on nearly all devices.

An in-depth article: http://www.vogella.de/articles/Android/article.html#installation

- and the article gives in general a good starting point for Android development in general covering important tools like the emulator, adb and the ddms.

Its of course also possible to look up the samples code directly - go to the path where the adb is installed e.g. ~/Applications/android-sdk-[version](version.md) and search for samples directories. Or browse it here: http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/ApiDemos/index.html
